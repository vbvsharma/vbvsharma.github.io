		Hi, I'm Vaibhav Sharma. Ever since I was a little kid, I have loved to build things - starting from nothing and transforming something that solves a problem, fills me with joy. Therefore, when I grew up, I went to college and earned a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering.
    </p>
    <p>
        Fast-forward to the present - Professionally, I am a Software Development Engineer at <a href="https://www.getfareye.com/">FarEye</a>, where I work on Java, AngularJS, ReactJS, Spring Boot, and few other technologies and frameworks, to provide deliverables. Personally, I am a learner and a tinkerer, who tries his hands on everything he can. I got interested in AI, especially in Machine Learning, during my 3rd year at college. And, this interest gradually turned into my passion, when I learned more about it. Hence, when I am not at <a href="https://www.getfareye.com/">FarEye</a>,
        I am probably making learning models, or reading how to build a new one.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am also an avid learner, always keen to learn. Therefore, I have done several courses on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a>, <a href="https://www.udacity.com/">Udacity</a>, and <a href="https://www.edx.org/">edX</a>, to quench my thirst.
